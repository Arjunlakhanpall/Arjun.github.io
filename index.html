        <h1>Arjun Lakhanpal - Exploring the Intersection of ECE and CS Programming</h1>
        <p>As a third-year student at GGSIPU | BPIT specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I am deeply intrigued by the fusion of electronic principles with the dynamic world of computer science programming languages. Currently based in New Delhi, my academic journey thus far has been marked by a dedication to learning and a passion for exploring the realms of technology.</p>
        <p>With a solid GPA of 3.80 out of 5.00, I've delved into a diverse array of coursework, spanning Circuit Analysis, Electronics, Digital Logic Design, Microprocessors, Signals and Systems, Electromagnetics, Control Systems, Communication Systems, Computer Architecture, Embedded Systems, Power Systems, VLSI Design, Digital Signal Processing, Networks, and Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>
        <p>Beyond the confines of traditional academia, I've immersed myself in the world of programming languages, with a keen interest in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Python (where I've undertaken several mini-projects), SQL, LaTeX, and MATLAB. I've also dabbled in cutting-edge technologies like MongoDB, GraphQL, Firebase, and honed my skills in Git/GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, and API development, including OWASP API.</p>
        <p>My skill set extends beyond technical prowess to encompass data modeling, Agile methodologies (particularly Scrum and Kanban), SOLID principles, design patterns, debugging techniques, and root cause analysis. I've also developed a strong grasp of system design for API systems and microservice architecture, reflecting my commitment to building robust and scalable solutions.</p>
        <p>As I continue on my academic and professional journey, I am driven by a curiosity to explore new technologies and an eagerness to apply my skills to real-world challenges. My goal is to leverage my interdisciplinary background in electronics and computer science to contribute meaningfully to the field and make a positive impact on society.</p>
